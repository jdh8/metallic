 * \brief Kernel of the exponential function
 *
 * This computes exponential functon in a domain of
 * \f$ \left[ -\frac{\ln2}{2}, \frac{\ln2}{2} \right] \f$.
 * The result is guaranteed to be faithfully rounded in \c float, whose
 * relative error is controlled within 1.078561e-8.
 *
 * If \a x is outside of
 * \f$ \left[ -\frac{\ln2}{2}, \frac{\ln2}{2} \right] \f$,
 * the result is inaccurate.
 *
 * \param x - The argument in \f$ \left[ -\frac{\ln2}{2}, \frac{\ln2}{2} \right] \f$
 * \return  Approximate e<sup><var>x</var></sup> &minus; 1 as precise as \c float.
